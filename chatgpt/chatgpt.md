### Overview
#### Models
OpenAI has three GPT flagship models, all of which are multilingual and used for text generation.
| | GPT-4o | GPT-4 Turbo | GPT-3.5 Turbo |
| - | ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| inputs | text, image | text, image | text |
| context length | 128k | 128k | 16k |
| cost (per 1M tokens) for input | $5 | $10 | $0.50 |
| cost (per 1M tokens) for output | $15 | $30 | $1.50 |

The blog post [here](https://dev.to/maximsaplin/gpt-4-128k-context-it-is-not-big-enough-1h02) (Saplin, 2023) provides insight into what this context length means.

Below are examples of short English texts and how many fit inside 128k tokens:

Below are examples of long English texts and how many fit inside 128k tokens:

It is a different question of how easy it is for the model to digest or make use of so much information (see below).

### OpenAI API
In addition to the GPT-based text generation models, OpenAI API can also be used for several other models, including DALL-E (text2image) and Whisper (speech2text).
